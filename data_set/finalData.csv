404580,Relive,"Relive is a game about cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but it is also an adventure game. The main purpose is to increase the awareness about this topic and push people, especially teenagers and young adults, to take a CPR classes and be prepared to intervene in case of need. While the topic is serious, we tried to create a fun and entertaining game, a SCI-FI opera where players can enjoy their gaming experience while the CPR concept slips through the game. To move forward in the story and complete successfully Relive, you will need to learn the bases of CPR, in an interesting and non-invasive way. To keep the CPR skills razor sharp a tournament mode encourages group play. Family, schools and friends will be able to organize fast and fun CPR challenges and see who will be able to beat the best score. Why CPR? In Europe every day 1.000 people die of cardiac arrest. If immediate CPR is performed, the chances of survival remarkably increase. In more than 70% of instances, cardiac arrest is witnessed and CPR could be initiated by bystanders. As of today, in Europe only in 15% of cases witnesses perform CPR (European average). Taking a CPR class is the best way to rise this 15% of bystanders and save lives with no additional risk. Is Relive really free? Yes, Relive is completely free. The development of this game was made possible thanks to Future of Health Award, which purpose is to “bring serious gaming and healthcare together in order to contribute to more advanced healthcare across Europe“.

1369370,Combat Mission Shock Force 2,"The latest title in the famous Combat Mission franchise of wargames, now on Steam. Shock Force 2 brings you to a hypothetical conflict in Syria between the forces of NATO and the Syrian Army. Take command of US Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCT) and Heavy Brigade Combat Teams (HBCT) to fight against Syrian Army Infantry, Mechanized and Armored units in an arid setting. Experience the full range of modern threats to conventional military forces, including irregular combat forces, terrorists, spies, suicide bombers, IED's and other deadly tools employed in the asymmetric warfare of the modern day. Play the Task Force Thunder campaign, more than a dozen carefully crafted battles, or unlimited Quick Battles. HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED Players are assigned detailed missions to accomplish based on a richly diverse set of Objectives. Missions can be played in either Real Time or our WeGo hybrid turn based mode introduced with the first Combat Mission game 20 years ago. WeGo allows each player to plan out 60 seconds of combat and then watch as both sides' commands are carried out simultaneously. The WeGo system also allows for re-watching turn action and playing against another player by email (PBEM) or 'hotseat' on a single computer. RealTime and WeGo head to head play can also use TCP/IP on a LAN or over the Internet. Massive replayability comes from a unique Quick Battle system which allows players to purchase their own custom force and fight over the battlefield of their choice from a wide array of different maps. A powerful map and scenario Editor allows you to create battles or campaigns for yourself and others. HOW UNITS ARE PORTRAYED All units are portrayed one for one in 1:1 scale in high resolution polygon 3D models with articulated suspensions, animated hatches, and other features that make them feel real. Unlike other 3D tactical wargames, Combat Mission combines real world physics with a thoroughly researched portrayal of forces, right down to what the individual soldiers cary into battle. Advanced vehicle damage modeling allows for tracking of each sub-system, including the most realistic ballistics, armor and post-armor effects available in any game. Unlike other games that claim this level of realism, Combat Mission actually delivers it across the whole spectrum of warfare, including the interaction of weather, lighting, and terrain on how units and their weapons function.  Perhaps the most important feature of Combat Mission is its detailed and innovative portrayal of 'soft factors'. Experience, Morale, Leadership, and other elements operate at the individual soldier level and collectively transform how units behave. As important as these battlefield concerns are, most other games give them short shrift or don't bother covering them at all. In the real world having the best weapons means nothing if the soldiers crewing them are balled up in fear or are too distracted to see what's going on around them. HOW THINGS WORK BEHIND THE SCENES Weapon penetration values and armor protection are based on extremely detailed real life data and scientific algorithms that are specific to exactly what is seen in the game. There are no arbitrary values (hitpoints) or precalculated resolution tables (CRTs) that so often produce frustratingly inaccurate results. The advanced Tactical AI (TacAI) models the psychological state and inherent qualities of every soldier on the battlefield, allowing for genuine battlefield behavior from every soldier as if they were their own free thinking individual.  The simulation of independent soldiers is important in another regard because it allows Combat Mission to have what we call Relative Spotting. This is a system which ensures that each soldier has their own unique view of the battlefield, avoiding the 'Borg' issue seen in many games where once one person has spotted an enemy, automatically everyone else has spotted it and can fire on it as well. Any wargamer worth his weight in gunpowder knows that Fog of War is one of the most important battlefield elements. An unprecedented simulation of Command and Control (C2) combines with Relative Spotting to realistically portray the flow of information and responsibility between soldiers as they share information with each other on what they can see on the battlefield  All of these elements, and many more, seamlessly fit together to create the most realistic battlefield experience out there. The realism level isn't pushed in your face with lots of data and obscure references. Instead players experience all of this with the 3D graphical environment. Combat Mission's visceral game environment is what attracts players, the richness of the gameplay is what keeps them playing for years on end. Features: - Tactical warfare at battalion and below scale in a true 3D environment - Command individual vehicles, teams, and squads - Expansive simulation of 'soft factors' such as Morale, Experience, and Leadership - Innovative systems portraying Fog of War, Spotting, Line of Sight, Command &amp; Control, and Objectives - Unmatched realistic physics, ballistics, and battlefield effects - Fight in a wide range of weather and lighting conditions, all of which realistically impact fighting abilities - Unique hybrid system for RealTime or WeGo (turn based) play - Full featured Editor for maps, scenarios, and campaigns - Quick Battle system sets up deliberate or randomized battles based on player specifications - Single player and head to head play, including Play By Email (PBEM) - Detailed and realistic combat formation for the United States Army and Syrian Army - Two types of Syrian Unconventional Forces, Spies, IEDs, and VIEDs - One large campaign, a small training campaign, 20 standalone scenarios, and numerous Quick Battle maps. - On map mortars, mortar vehicles, drones, anti-aircraft fire, and other modern warfare features - Expanded arid combat environment, now including waterways, bridges, and other new terrain - Intricately detailed and highly realistic combat equipment for the United States Army and Syrian Army, including 41 vehicles and 35 assorted small arms and crew weapons. - Expansive maps with 1m x 1m resolution allow for short and long range action across complex terrain - Buildings have explicitly simulated doors, windows, and floors - Weather and ground condition modelling systems allow for everything from dry sunny days to muddy stormy nights, with visibility and mobility dynamically affected by the conditions. Some Combat Mission games include the full range of Winter, Spring, and Fall weather as well - Line of Sight and Line of Fire are separately calculated, which means sometimes you can see something you can't shoot and sometimes you can shoot at things you can't see - Soldier posture (prone, kneeling, standing) affects everything including spotting, cover, and ability to engage enemies - Line of Sight is calculated from the 'eyeballs' or 'sensor' point, not a generic value - Much of Combat Mission's realism comes from correctly simulating important low level details, such as crew responsibilities, vehicle vision blocks, high tech sensors, etc. A 3 man tank with a few cloudy vision blocks doesn't have to be artificially made inferior to a 5 man tank with a commander's cupola and separate vision blocks for the gunner and loader because in Combat Mission it happens naturally - The way a nation organizes its units has a huge impact on how they perform in combat, therefore great pains are taken to accurately portray formations as they are in real life for a particular point in time - Lighting affects combat in no small way in real life as well as in the game. The correct lighting conditions are simulated based on time of day, time of year, and weather","Aug 31, 2020",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1369370/header.jpg?t=1615392986,https://www.slitherine.com/steam,"Simulation,Strategy","Simulation,Strategy,RTS,Wargame,Turn-Based Strategy,Turn-Based Tactics,3D,Military,Alternate History,Historical,Tactical,Tanks,War,PvP,Artificial Intelligence,Turn-Based Combat,Multiplayer,Singleplayer,Local Multiplayer,Combat"
296210,Brigade E5: New Jagged Union,"Brigade E5: New Jagged Union is a tactical game that places gamers in the small tropical nation of Palinero on the verge of a civil war. The mission: hire a band of mercenaries and take control of the deteriorating situation before the country finds itself in complete ruin. The story offers players an opportunity to experience three different viewpoints of the conflict or work out the political structure to achieve their own goals in the global domination. Game play for the title is based on an innovative combat system called SPMÂ® (Smart Pause Mode) that successfully blends together real-time and turn-based games. Unlike standard turn-based systems, Brigade E5: New Jagged Union does not use 'action points' while in turn-based mode, but takes into consideration the character skills and attributes resulting in more natural and diverse behavior of units. Furthermore players can issue a chain of commands that will be carried out automatically. The choice of weapons will satisfy even highly demanding fans, with more than 100 accurately modeled firearms, varied ammunition types, grenades, body armor and special equipment. Players will be also able to modify and upgrade weapons by adding various gadgets, sniper scopes, mini grenade launchers, bayonets, etc. The game provides extensive LAN and Internet Multiplayer modes, with CTF, Deathmatch and Fortress dynamic gameplay. SPM® is a brand new feature for the squad combat strategy genre. It gives all players a chance to command their soldiers at the same time, using even an enemy's pause.","Apr 30, 2014",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/296210/header.jpg?t=1656589575,,"Simulation,Strategy","Strategy,Simulation,Tactical,Singleplayer"

CS: GO promises to expand on CS' award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac.'","Aug 21, 2012",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730/header.jpg?t=1641233427,http://blog.counter-strike.net/,"Action,Free to Play","FPS,Shooter,Multiplayer,Competitive,Action,Team-Based,e-sports,Tactical,First-Person,PvP,Online Co-Op,Co-op,Strategy,Military,War,Difficult,Trading,Realistic,Fast-Paced,Moddable"

1477830,HudSight - custom crosshair overlay,"HudSight tool draws your custom crosshair directly in a game screen. Our software uses overlay rendering technique which works both in full screen exclusive and windowed modes. Everyone knows that a game running in the full screen mode gets better performance and lowest possible input lag. But there is a problem with common 'on top' overlay tools. They cannot work in this full screen mode. HudSight can do it. Set one of pre-installed crosshairs or select your own image and that's all! Run a game and software will do the rest of work - your image will be automatically centered on the game screen. HudSight supports games based on DirectX 9, 10, 11, 12, OpenGL and Vulkan graphics. 32 and 64-bits games are welcome. It works on Windows 7, 8 and 10. Games compatibility Some games don't allow 3rd party overlays. For example, Destiny 2 or Forza Horizon 4. Some games allow overlays but with limitations, as example - CSGO which must be started with -allow_third_party_software key in the command line Anti-cheats compatibility HudSight works in the same manner as most of recording/streaming tools. This tool is not a cheat, it doesn't change games files or game play, it just draws an overlay (like Steam service). You only need to be sure that the Terms of Service of a game you play do not deny such enhancement.","Jan 5, 2021",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1477830/header.jpg?t=1620746309,https://hudsight.com,"Education,Software Training,Utilities,Video Production","Utilities,Education,Software Training,Video Production"
1068820,OVR Toolkit,"** Please read this section before purchasing! ** - OVR Toolkit *only* supports Windows 10 and 11! Not Windows 7 or Windows 8. Windows 8.1 'may' work but is unsupported! - OVR Toolkit *requires* you to have a Windows account with admin permissions and that you run Steam on this same account. - Oculus users may experience decreased performance as games are required to be ran through SteamVR rather than Oculus Runtime. (Read the 'Important Stuff' section!) Oculus Rift/S or Oculus Quest/2 users - Read the 'Important Stuff' section before purchase! Overview OVR Toolkit is a SteamVR Overlay utility designed to make viewing the desktop within VR easy and intuitive. OVR Toolkit allows you to display specific desktop windows, quickly select between them, use intuitive controls to navigate those windows, and use a virtual keyboard to type. Ever wanted to reply to Discord messages without taking off your headset or looking through a nose piece? Ever wanted to pause that song you're listening to without fumbling around on your keyboard? Now you can with ease! OVR Toolkit is compatible with all SteamVR compatible headsets. The utility is being built with the Vive/Vive Pro, Valve Index, and Oculus Rift/Rift S in mind though WMR headsets are compatible too. (Compatible controllers require a trigger and grip) Features Overlays over almost all SteamVR applications: OVR Toolkit will display on top of all your favorite titles! (VRChat, Beat Saber, mostly all SteamVR titles, etc.) Desktop window viewing: Allows you to select a desktop window and display it above your hand, or pin it in the world around you. Multiple desktop windows: Create multiple different windows and place them in the world around you. Attach windows to tracked devices: You can make windows move around with either your left or right controllers, headset, or have them stationary in the world. Curved overlays: Improves readability of large windows in VR by wrapping them around you by a configurable amount? Now you can! (Or you can make the window into a wall by curving it to the max, I don't judge!) Window re-centering: Optionally enable window re-centering, this will make window's re-appear in front of you when you open Edit Mode. This is useful to easily pull windows to you so you can use them. Quick selection of desktop windows: OVR Toolkit contains a configuration 'hotkey' menu that allows you to bind buttons on its UI to switch between specific windows in one click. Intuitive desktop input: Scroll up and down on windows by dragging, make a selection by dragging, like using your finger on a phone but with a VR controller instead! (This makes a lot more sense than it sounds like it does!) Wristwatch: An overlay displayed on your hand that displays the time, date, as well as Vive/Index controller/Tracker battery percentages, as well as other values such as CPU/GPU/VRAM usage. Saving/Loading configurations: Like that sweet setup you've made? Well, now you can save it, and load it again next time you launch! Advanced settings for window capture: Want that 60 FPS window capture experience? Want to make a window slightly transparent so it's less in the way? Want a window to disappear when you're not looking at it? Or when it's past a set distance from you? You can do these with our advanced settings! Eco Mode: When enabled, performance mode will lower the capture rate of windows you are not using, this drastically increases performance and lowers CPU usage significantly! Basic media controls: Spotify currently playing song will show on your wrist, along with a play/pause, skip, and previous button. (These buttons will work in other music players too) Windows notifications: Display your Windows notifications in VR such as Discord messages, 'Your Phone' notifications, and anything else that would typically appear on your desktop as a push notification. Customization Customize the background (wallpaper) and logo on the phone-like UI. Choose between several accent colors for various parts of the UI. Create hotkeys on the home page that show application's icons and allow you to quickly access your commonly used applications. Customize keyboard layouts! All keyboard layouts are community made within Unity and documentation is provided so you can do this yourself. (Want the keys to spell out funny things like you're in high school again? Now you can!) Custom Apps allow web developers to integrate web apps into OVR Toolkit, allowing for integrated Twitch chat and games to be made. Simulator Mode - Controller-free mode 'Simulator Mode' is a controller-free mode available in OVR Toolkit. In this mode, you can interact with windows using head gaze, and use keyboard binds to move windows around you and change their settings. This mode is perfect for those intending to use OVR Toolkit at a desk or whilst in a sim racing/driving/piloting game! (This mode is still a work in progress, provide feedback in the OVR Toolkit Discord!) Move windows with keyboard binds when you have no controllers connected. Control your cursor position with your head using head-gaze input. Pin windows around you in your play space to view whilst in games. (Race overlays, etc.) Quickly toggle open windows with the 'Edit Mode' bind to show/hide some applications such as Discord, web browsers, etc. whilst in games. Voice Attack ready. (All controls are easily repeatable with the same keyboard key presses to support Voice Attack) Bindable voice input key using Google Speech to type out a sentence into a text box you have selected. Important stuff you should know about We've tried our best to make OVR Toolkit support everything, but that just isn't how this world works! Please take these compatibility notes in mind before purchasing: OVR Toolkit requires being launched as admin, this is due to the inability to capture programs that are running as admin without running OVR Toolkit as admin, so it's needless to say a Windows account with admin privileges is needed. (If you're the only user of your PC, this is probably you) OVR Toolkit only supports Windows 10 and 11. (This is due to the desktop capture API we use which was only introduced in Windows 10) Oculus users, don't launch OVR Toolkit through Oculus Home as it will launch the application incorrectly! Use Steam/SteamVR instead! You can set OVR Toolkit to auto-start with SteamVR by referring to our wiki! Oculus' software will sometimes overlay over our overlay. (This is because Oculus' software displays separate to SteamVR, our application will always display whilst SteamVR is active or you're playing a SteamVR game, just not when you open the Oculus Dashboard) Oculus users, refer to the OVR Toolkit wiki 'Oculus' page for how to make OVR Toolkit appear in your games! We cannot display our application over Oculus SDK games. (Our application uses SteamVR to display, though, most Oculus games will have a SteamVR mode, we advise you use this!) Running games through SteamVR on an Oculus headset may decrease performance, this is not an issue specific to OVR Toolkit. This is due to Oculus rendering the same image twice, once when SteamVR compositor renders the output, then again when Oculus Runtime renders the output. Unfortunately, this is something only Oculus/Facebook can fix! Windows Mixed Reality users may experience decreased performance running SteamVR games due to double rendering.

384300,CPUCores :: Maximize Your FPS,"CPUCores is a cutting-edge Windows based software built by gamers, specifically for gamers, with 1 thing in mind: INCREASE YOUR FPS! CPUCores does this by micromanaging your Windows OS and non-essential applications to delivery maximum CPU to your game! 1) DIRECT STEAM INTEGRATION CPUCores automatically detects all of your Steam games. 2) OS OPTIMIZATION To start, CPUCores will isolate your entire OS to your first core. Secondly, CPUCores examines and constrains key Windows services that are not essential and known to hog CPU resources. Third, CPUCores examines and isolate key Windows processes to ensure a perfect balance of CPU savings without starving key Windows processes. 3) GAME OPTIMIZATION CPUCores will isolate and dedicate processing cores to be exclusively used by your game. CPUCores will allow game-specific hyper-thread disabling/enabling. 4) BACKGROUND / NON-GAME OPTIMIZATIONS CPUCores examines what non-OS and non-game operations your PC is running. It will do things such as constrain non-game programs to your first processing core. 5) EXTRAS Ability to 'START RANDOM GAME' with 1 button click! Fully supporting VR games! Support for non-Steam games Support for general, non-game applications like video editing, graphic design and more! Convenient game sorting options makes large Steam libraries manageable Incredible community surrounding the software! Direct contact with the developer for suggestions on feature updates! The impact of how CPUCores will help with FPS depends on essentially 2 things: #1 Your PC Hardware #2 The game itself Here are some benchmarks we've recently seen from our test system: ARMA III - 17.5% FPS Increase! Team Fortress 2 - 58% FPS Increase! TombRaider - 6.3% FPS Increase Left4Dead2 - 14% FPS Increase The CPUCores application identifies dozens of Windows programs, background processes, and non-gaming applications, and immediately controls and isolates them to a subsection of your total CPU resources. CPUCores will then free up a block of CPU resources and dedicated it specifically for a game. You can then launch a Steam game, or any game/program, directly via the CPUCores application. This enables CPUCores to control the processor usage for that game/program and ensure it has dedicated usage to processing cores. Your game no longer has to share resources with the OS / other applications.

719890,Beasts of Bermuda,"Beasts of Bermuda is a multiplayer game hosting large servers in which the player is a dinosaur or other prehistoric creature. A player can take the role of flyers, swimmers, herbivores, carnivores, and semi-aquatic creatures that fulfill different niches in the ecosystem. No matter what the player chooses to be, the objective of the game is to survive and grow up on the islands of Bermuda by using their particular creature's abilities. Predation from other players as well as intense environmental events are the antagonistic forces in the game the player must survive against. There are currently three game modes in Beasts of Bermuda. The first is our Life Cycle mode of gameplay. The player selects a creature of choice and spawns into the world as a juvenile of that species. They must survive and gradually grow larger over time. As growth accumulates, they also earn talents, which can be spent to enhance different aspects of your creature's capabilities. The second is Free Roam, which allows the player to instantly spawn as an adult with a fixed number of talent points. Death has little consequence, as there are no growth mechanics, or other mechanics that reward the player for staying alive. The third game mode is Combat. This mode pits players against one another with small maps, close spawns, and mechanics designed to reward conflict. The player can accrue more talent points by killing other players and stealing their points.","Dec 21, 2018",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/719890/header.jpg?t=1652434628,http://beastsofbermuda.com,"Adventure,Indie,Massively Multiplayer,Simulation,Early Access","Simulation,Dinosaurs,Massively Multiplayer,Survival,Adventure,Indie,Open World,Multiplayer,Early Access,PvP,Realistic,Sandbox,Third Person,Horror"

1345870,Franchise Hockey Manager 7,"The Franchise Hockey Manager series returns for the 2020-21 season with plenty of new additions to the deepest, most authentic hockey strategy gaming experience you can find. Choose one of dozens of leagues around the world and select a team to guide to glory, including a chance at the ultimate prize: FHM7 is licensed by the NHL®, allowing you to take the reins of your favorite franchise to capture the Stanley Cup®. Take control of a national team and try for international supremacy. Choose a historical game, where you can begin in any year in NHL® history right back to the beginning in 1917. Or if you'd like to create your own customized league, you can do that as well! However you choose to play, you have control of your team and can oversee finances, select strategies, hire your staff, make trades, sign free agents, and draft the newest generation of stars as you try to build a championship team - and then make it into a dynasty! FHM7: Live Every Moment. All new for Franchise Hockey Manager 7: 2D Game Engine: Our game simulation has been rebuilt from the ground up, and now shows games in a top-down, fully-animated view that lets you see every second of the action! Historical International Tournaments: International games have been added to historical play, so you can control a team in legendary events like the 1972 Summit Series and the Miracle on Ice in 1980. We've also added a large number of non-NHL players to the historical database, so if you want to see what the cold war-era NHL would've looked like with the stars of the Soviet bloc added, that's now possible. More Customization for Custom Leagues: We've made the custom league setup much more flexible - you can now add as many leagues as you want, all of them fully customizable. The playoff editor also has a new custom configuration option in addition to the pre-set default systems. Redesigned Scouting System: The scouting interface has been simplified and made a little more visually appealing with the addition of maps showing the coverage your team (and individual scouts) have. Scouting reports have also been changed to provide more useful and relevant information, and Scouting Levels now include an estimate of the player's likelihood of reaching his potential. Reworked Draft Screen: Mock drafts, a draft review, and scout recommendations have been added. Additionally, we've moved the draft dates in modern and custom games - they now occur in early July, as they do in historical, which allows expansion teams to participate in them during their first season. Configurable Historical Evolution: When when you opt to turn on historical editing, you can now specify if you want changes like league foundings/closures, team expansion and deactivation, and rule changes to continue as they did historically or not, in any configuration you want. More Farm Team Control: If you want more control over your farm team, you can now have direct control over their depth charts and staff hiring. Schedule Editing: A long-requested feature, schedules can now be exported for editing, and then re-imported. Waiver and Intraleague Drafts: The beloved Waiver Draft has been added to historical play in the years it existed, along with its predecessor, the Intraleague Draft. Additionally, both are also available as options that can be activated for any other type of league. And that's only the beginning! Other significant changes and additions include: Reworked the news screen to show more headlines and flag personal messages and those which need a reply. Real-life full-career stats are now included on the player screens in historical mode, so you can see if a player is matching his real performance...or cheat a little, if you want to see how a potential draft pick really turns out. A team search tab has been added to the player and staff search. Various international upgrades: national teams run by the user no longer clear rosters after tournaments end, so you don't need to rebuild them, international staff histories are now recorded, and we've made various UI improvements and fixes to get the international screens working a little better. The continue button now alerts to you to upcoming events like drafts and trade deadlines. Database improvements like significantly expanded international stats histories for players, award histories for most leagues, and more The success of a national team now has an effect on the quality of new players generated by that country. Players can now be designated as Untouchable if you don't want to get trade offers for them, and players on other teams can be flagged as 'Not Interested' if you don't want them to be included in trade offers to you. The Aging attribute had been split into Aging and a new attribute, Development Rate to make our modelling of player career arcs more flexible. Roster AI has received a number of adjustments, mainly in the area of how the AI determines player value; most of these are designed to take advantage of systems (line chemistry, etc.) that didn't exist when the last major roster AI revision was done. AI teams' free agent-signing behaviour has also been improved. The player search screen's filter now allows minimum ratings scores to be included in the filter criteria.-We've made some database and player generation changes to significantly reduce the memory usage of long-term leagues, allowing much better long-term game performance for users with limited RAM. Many new things are editable on the player, team, and league screens - contract settings, favourites, foreign player restrictions, among others. Boxscores can now be exported as csv files. The later years of historical player data got a lot of re-work, fixing some inaccuracies and significantly adding to the number of post-2010 players who haven't made the NHL yet In addition to all of that, there are the usual large variety of smaller and internal changes, tweaks, database changes, interface improvements, and the 20-21 team and player updates!","Dec 16, 2020",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1345870/header.jpg?t=1633690466,https://www.ootpdevelopments.com/franchise-hockey-manager-home/,"Simulation,Sports,Strategy","Strategy,Sports,Hockey,Simulation,Management,2D,Singleplayer,Tactical,Text-Based,Choices Matter,Trading"

594570,Total War: WARHAMMER II,"DEFEND YOUR WORLD. DESTROY THEIRS. Total War: WARHAMMER II is a strategy game of titanic proportions. Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way – mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world. This is a game of two halves – one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World. Play how you choose – delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same. World-Spanning Conquest Engage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal. Epic Real-Time Battles Command thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory. The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date. Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities. Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles. Conquer the world, together Each of the Races in Total War™ WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you’ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you’ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own. The World of Total War: WARHAMMER II Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent. Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex – and great opportunity in its demise. Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh… Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill.","Sep 28, 2017",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/594570/header.jpg?t=1644489785,,"Action,Strategy","Strategy,Fantasy,Turn-Based Strategy,RTS,Grand Strategy,War,Multiplayer,Games Workshop,Action,Turn-Based,Singleplayer,Dark Fantasy,Co-op,Tactical,Real Time Tactics,Story Rich,Atmospheric,Dinosaurs,Great Soundtrack,Warhammer 40K"

582010,Monster Hunter: World,"Welcome to a new world! Take on the role of a hunter and slay ferocious monsters in a living, breathing ecosystem where you can use the landscape and its diverse inhabitants to get the upper hand. Hunt alone or in co-op with up to three other players, and use materials collected from fallen foes to craft new gear and take on even bigger, badder beasts! INTRODUCTION Overview Battle gigantic monsters in epic locales. As a hunter, you'll take on quests to hunt monsters in a variety of habitats. Take down these monsters and receive materials that you can use to create stronger weapons and armor in order to hunt even more dangerous monsters. In Monster Hunter: World, the latest installment in the series, you can enjoy the ultimate hunting experience, using everything at your disposal to hunt monsters in a new world teeming with surprises and excitement. Setting Once every decade, elder dragons trek across the sea to travel to the land known as the New World in a migration referred to as the Elder Crossing. To get to the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon, the Guild has formed the Research Commission, dispatching them in large fleets to the New World. As the Commission sends its Fifth Fleet in pursuit of the colossal elder dragon, Zorah Magdaros, one hunter is about to embark on a journey grander than anything they could have ever imagined. ECOSYSTEM A World That Breathes Life There are various locations teeming with wildlife. Expeditions into these locales are bound to turn up interesting discoveries. HUNTING A Diverse Arsenal, and an Indispensable Partner Your equipment will give you the power to need to carve out a place for yourself in the New World. The Hunter's Arsenal There are fourteen different weapons at the hunter's disposal, each with its own unique characteristics and attacks. Many hunters acquire proficiency in multiple types, while others prefer to attain mastery of one. Scoutflies Monster tracks, such as footprints and gashes, dot each locale. Your Scoutflies will remember the scent of a monster and guide you to other nearby tracks. And as you gather more tracks, the Scoutflies will give you even more information. Slinger The Slinger is an indispensable tool for a hunter, allowing you to arm yourself with stones and nuts that can be gathered from each locale. From diversion tactics to creating shortcuts, the Slinger has a variety of uses, and allows you to hunt in new and interesting ways. Specialized Tools Specialized tools activate powerful effects for a limited amount of time, and up to two can be equipped at a time. Simple to use, they can be selected and activated just like any other item you take out on a hunt. Palicoes Palicoes are hunters' reliable comrades out in the field, specialized in a variety of offensive, defensive, and restorative support abilities. The hunter's Palico joins the Fifth Fleet with pride, as much a bona fide member of the Commission as any other hunter.","Aug 9, 2018",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/582010/header.jpg?t=1644281885,http://www.monsterhunterworld.com/,Action,"Co-op,Multiplayer,Action,Open World,RPG,Third Person,Character Customization,Adventure,Fantasy,Singleplayer,Difficult,Action RPG,Exploration,Great Soundtrack,Replay Value,Atmospheric,Hack and Slash,JRPG,Souls-like,MMORPG"
346110,ARK: Survival Evolved,"As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new 'Engrams' to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D 'Explorer Notes'. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

294100,RimWorld,"RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune. You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions. Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more. Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses. Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there's much more than that!

There is only Chernarus – 230 square kilometers of post-Soviet country that was struck by an unknown virus, which turned the majority of its population into raging infected. Your task? To survive the collapse of civilization for as long as you possibly can. Keep in mind that death is permanent in unforgiving Chernarus. All you’ll have when you start over again are the memories of your final mistake. Meet Others Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert. Trust no one. Survive Chernarus The infected aren’t the only ones you need to worry about – there’s also the wildlife and elements. Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night. You’ll also need to master complex survival mechanics concerning your hunger, thirst, body temperature, and more. Loot Up Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in your secret base under a cover of well-placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and keep your eyes peeled for precious loot.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"Death Is Not an Escape. Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed. Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey. The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. More information about the game is available at Key Features • Survive Together… Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground? • Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play. • A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. • Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer. • Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog.

903950,Last Oasis,"Last Oasis is a Nomadic Survival MMO . Earth has stopped rotating, and the last human survivors need to outrun the scorching Sun in a massive Open World . Traverse the world on your walker: a wooden, wind-powered machine inspired by Theo Jansen’s amazing strandbeests. Walkers are mobile bases that can be adapted for travel, transportation, harvesting, and combat. Personalize your walker to fit your needs with a multitude of structures, attachments, and upgrades! The sun burns the land in the west, turning it to dust. In order to stay ahead of the obliterating sun, nomads must explore new territories that slowly emerge on the eastern horizon, where the Earth has long been frozen in impenetrable ice. After a cataclysmic event halted the Earth’s rotation, the planet was split into two extreme and deadly environments. Only a narrow region between the burning and freezing halves of the planet can support life. This region moves as the planet orbits around the sun, and all living creatures must migrate with it to survive. In order to keep moving, the remnants of humanity have built nomadic machines, and a walking city called the Flotilla. Survive by exploiting what’s left of the world: find a source of water, hunt ferocious creatures, fend off pirates, brew mind-bending Vitamins, and uncover hidden walker technologies. Build autonomous machines to harness the power of the wind. Claw your way from a ragged nomadic trader to the heights of a mercenary king, fleet commander, or a legendarily-rich merchant. There are trade networks that stretch between the discovered oases. In this global, player-driven economy, smart and quick traders can take advantage of supply and demand to make huge profits. Other nomads may opt to produce or hunt down rare and highly localized resources. It’s always wise to consider potential competitors first, though. Threaten another clan’s operation, and you may become their next target. The large, open world is made up of many interconnected oases that are over 100km2 each. Potentially thousands of oases exist simultaneously – the number automatically adjusts to accommodate the size of the playerbase. Explore them to reveal new and unique biomes while plundering their limited resources. Some nomads may pitstop to refill their water. Others will settle for some time, but ultimately everyone will pick up and voyage east to escape the encroaching sun. The Wasteland is a safe, open stretch of desert that sits between the last livable oases on Earth. It can be used to travel to adjacent oases, or as a place to hide your walker and safely log off with all your belongings. Last Oasis features dynamic, skill-based directional melee combat. Nomads can choose their weapon from a wide range of both one and two-handed swords, maces, axes, and quarterstaves. If you prefer ranged combat, you can customize your walker with weapons like ballistas, scattershot guns, repeaters, or even giant slingshots. Specialize in one or become a more versatile fighter by trying to master them all. Construct portable bases or more permanent fortifications to protect yourself from hostile nomads and wildlife. Stone walls offer superior defense, while lighter wooden structures are able to be packed on large walkers and relocated. Individuals and small groups of players have as many opportunities as clans to prosper. Clans might control territories and lead the economy, but cunning traders, skilled mercenaries, agile hunters and pirates will find niches that better suit solo play. While solo play will always be a viable playstyle, social features like voice chat make it easy to meet new friends and team up to kill some of the largest creatures. Grow your clan into a political and economic power. Control a region and get rewarded with a supply of local resources gathered there by roaming nomads. Make alliances to protect your income, because war is always around the corner. Enemy clans will challenge your control and threaten to take away everything you’ve built. Master the vertical movement. Every Nomad owns a grappling hook; it’s a tool that can be adapted to almost any playstyle. It’s all about your skill: some struggle to climb the smallest rocks, while others swing through forests outspeeding the fastest Walkers. Dubbed ' The Long Ones ', these roaming creatures are the biggest threats nomads will face. The worms are ravenous. Once the beast focuses on a walker, it loses sight of everything else. In order to defeat the worm, experienced nomadic hunters must band together. Entering its territory underprepared will mean certain death. If the hunters succeed, they’ll have a reason to tap a few barrels of fermented cacti. They’ve just gotten their hands on some of the rarest and most sought-after resources – enough to make their entire crew rich and powerful.","Mar 26, 2020",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/903950/header.jpg?t=1657024148,https://lastoasis.gg/,"Action,Adventure,Indie,Massively Multiplayer,RPG,Early Access","Massively Multiplayer,Survival,Open World,Action,Adventure,RPG,Indie,Crafting,Building,Multiplayer,Sandbox,PvP,Early Access,Third Person,Post-apocalyptic,Violent,PvE,Economy,MMORPG,Swordplay"
